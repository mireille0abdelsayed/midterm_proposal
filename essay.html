          <p>
            The website is a letter to my younger self and to all girls who might be struggling with self-love. Inspired by America Ferrera's monologue in the "Barbie" movie, women nowadays find it harder to accept and love themselves because of all the expetations made by society. As someone who has struggled with loving herself in her own body, I think it is important to project that message to other women and help them understand that they are enough. They are beautiful in every way and do not need to change to please others. 
            "It's too hard! It's too contradictory and nobody gives you a medal or says thank you! And it turns out in fact that not only are you doing everything wrong, but also everything is your fault. I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us." -America Ferrera
